# Requirement
  
  tensorflow 1.3.0
  
  python 2.7.12
  
  numpy 1.13.1
  
  scipy 0.17.0
  
# Usage
  (1)download this repo to your own directory
  
    $ git clone https://github.com/nnUyi/CycleGAN.git
    
  (2)download celebA dataset and store it in the datasets directory(directory named datasets, sub-directory name celebA), in this repo, I just use the face images with no attributes. Input is the original images without any cropping operation, then it will be cropped into given resolution in this repo.
  
  (3)training
  
    $ python main.py --is_training=True
    
  (4)sampling
    
    Sampling process is executed in training time. You can see the sampling results in the directory named sample

# Experiments
  The result shows below, after 15 epoches, we can clearly obtain such a good experimental result.
